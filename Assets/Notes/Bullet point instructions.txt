Numbered bullet points that contain all information to be communicated (i.e all required details). Bullet points can have sub-bullet points, and sub-bullet points can have their own sub-bullet points and so on, however the deepest level of a bullet-point should be the smallest form of a bullet point, i.e. the smallest piece of info that can be communicated on its own (other than prerequisites).
