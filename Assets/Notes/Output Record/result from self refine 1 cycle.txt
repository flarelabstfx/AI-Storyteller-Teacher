While the primary argument of the piece is largely convincing, there are a few issues with it. One issue is that some of the figures presented in the piece are highly suspect. The author seems to have been under the impression that $p(x) = p_0 e^{-x}$, where $p_0$ is a parameter to be determined, is a valid probability distribution, when in reality this is not the case. The reason for this is that $p_0$ needs to be a non-negative quantity, and any value of $x>0$ violates this requirement. In fact, it can be shown that this is the case for any constant $p_0>0$. To avoid this issue, the piece should present the alternative $p(x) = p_0 \frac{e^{-x}-e^{-p_0}}{1-e^{-p_0}}$. Another issue is that it is not clear from the text which value of $p_0$ should be chosen, and the choices presented seem to be purely arbitrary. The text could be made more convincing by presenting a more convincing argument for choosing a particular value of $p_0$.
